# resumeApp

This project was conceived to experiment with technologies i am learning including Azure (including devops, pipelines, webapps, container registries...), React, Three.js, 
and to experiment I threw in react bootstrap to use their premade components. 

In future I plan to automate this further, including defining the web app service and pipelines in Terraform.
